Answer these questions using Markdown in the assignment submission text field.

1. Where, and in what order, does the processor look for a piece of data?

A: 1st: Register, 2nd: Cache, 3rd: Memory(RAM), 4th: Persistance Storage


2. Assuming a total size of 4 Gigabytes and 16-bit memory locations, what number of locations does the RAM provide?

4 billion * 8 bits/(16 bits/location) = 2 billion locations

3. Whatâ€™s the difference between volatile and persistent memory and which types exist in our memory pyramid?

Volatile memory exists only when the computer has power.  There are three main types: Registers, Cache,
and Memeory (Random Access Memory or "RAM"). Register memory is the fastest, then Cache, then RAM.
Persistent memory exists even when powered down. This is hard drive memory.  It is the slowest to access and
manipulate.
