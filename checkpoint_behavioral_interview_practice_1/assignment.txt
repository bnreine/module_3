Employees focused on: work experience, work style, and how you deal with obstacles






1. What unique qualities do you bring to this team?
Problem Solving Framework
Teaching skills **
Communication skills
Full Stack JavaScript NERDS Stack
PhD in Chemical Engineering from Stanford University


Teaching Skills---> I look for high level principles and
come up with creative ways to teach those high level principles


Situation: With student learning momentum in phsyics.  Task: teach her how to apply the conservation
of momentum.  Action: I explained to her that conservation of momentum was simply a combination
of newton's second and third law.  Result: She realized that conservation of momentum is
not a new concept, but an amalgamation of two high level concepts that she always understands.

Situation: Friend telling me about how a vaccine works.  Task: Understand how a vaccine works.
Action: I reflected back to him that your immune system is like an army during peacetime.  The vaccine
is a small amount of information that the army learns of how to attack a potential enemy.  Then, when the
enemy attacks, they're prepared to fight the enemy.  Result: I understood how the vaccine worked and
he was appreciative for a fresh perspective to teach others.






2. Why are you interested in programming?

I enjoy troubleshooting code----> Here's an example
Situation: I had an error in a reddit clone project but didn't know where the error came from.  Task: add
a topic resource to the application starting from the jasmine test.  Action: I stepped through the
problem from test suite, to router, to controller, to db query interface.  When I found where the break
point was, I realized that there was a syntax error in the require statement for the topic resource.  Result:
I corrected the error and the tests passed.





3. Tell me about a challenge you overcame.

Situation: Confused by the complexity of the min cut problem, Task: Solve min cut graph problem,
Action: Take a step back.  Write out an extremely simplified version start to finish to observe the
algorithm in a specific example.  Result: Extended the specific example to a general algorithm and
completed the problem.
