1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

-Making coffee;

PUT coffee filter in coffee maker
OPEN coffee can
SCOOP coffee into coffee filter
FILL coffee pot with water to desired level
POUR water into coffee maker
START coffee maker


-Washing dishes;

TURN hot water on
SOAK dishes with gunk on them
PUT dish soap in large container
FILL large container with hot water
TURN water off
WHILE there are still dirty dishes
  WASH each dish
END WHILE
TURN hot water on
WHILE there are still soapy dishes
  RINSE each dish
  PLACE each dish in drying area
END WHILE
TURN hot water off


-A choice of your own.

Driving to the gym:

WALK to car
UNLOCK car
OPEN door
GET in car
PUT key in ignition
START ignition
DRIVE To gym
PARK car
TAKE keys out of ignition
GET out of car
CLOSE door
LOCK car


2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem.
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies
who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm.
It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product).
Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about
each of your cases make them stand out?

-Wim Hof Breathing: Roughly doubles your breath holding time within 30 minutes.
-Fluent Forever (blog and book by Gabriel Wyner): Language retention forever.
-DiSSS (Meta learning acronym by Tim Ferriss): Meta learning method to learn any skill lightning fast.



3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An efficient algorithm gets the the solution using minimal resources (time, space)
An inefficient algorithm is the opposite.
