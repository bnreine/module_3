Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A. To express an algorithm in language that domain experts (not just coders) understand.  It contains all the necessary logic without any connection
to a particular coding language.


2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A.  Only humans understand pseudocode.  It shows the logic of the algorithm.  A computer will not understand this until a programmer writes this
in a language the compputer understands.


Programming Assignment


Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A.

FUNCTION "findGreater" with two inputs: numberOne and numberTwo
  IF numberOne greater than numberTwo THEN
    Display "first number is bigger than the second number"
  ELSE IF numberTwo greater than numberOne THEN
    Display "second number is bigger than the first number"
  ELSE
    Display "Both numbers are equal"
  END IF
  RETURN nothing
END FUNCTION




2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A.

FUNCTION "printNumbers" with no inputs
  FOR each number from 1 to 100
    Display number
  END FOR
END FUNCTION


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A.

FUNCTION "findEntry" with 2 inputs: phonebook and phoneNumber
  FOR each entry in phonebook
      IF entry = phoneNumber THEN
        RETURN entry
      END IF
  END FOR
  RETURN "Phone number doesn't exist in phonebook"
END FUNCTION



4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
